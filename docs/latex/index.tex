I think technically this is a game engine. Whatever it is, it\textquotesingle{}s certainly incomplete and in-\/development...

\section*{Description}

This is a library to aid in the creation of (2D) games using Open\+GL and S\+D\+L2. It was originally created while following tutorials on the \href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5m1_llmeiAdZMo_ZanIvg}{\tt Making\+Games\+With\+Ben} youtube channel, but it has its differences from \href{https://github.com/Barnold1953/GraphicsTutorials}{\tt the library} written in that series. This library is here for me to learn a little about game development; it\textquotesingle{}s not production quality, so I can\textquotesingle{}t recommend using it in your own projects. However, if you want an example of what\textquotesingle{}s buildable with it, you can check out \href{https://github.com/NivenT/Planet}{\tt this game} that I\textquotesingle{}m writing in part just to exercise this library.

Documentation can be found \href{https://nivent.github.io/jubilant-funicular/html/index.html}{\tt here}

\section*{Requirements}

Ideally, there would be no dependencies and all the necessary code would be written by me, but that\textquotesingle{}s not the case, so make sure you have


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.opengl.org/}{\tt Open\+GL}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://glew.sourceforge.net/}{\tt Glew}
\item \href{http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/}{\tt G\+L\+UT}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php}{\tt S\+D\+L2}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+D\+L2-\/mixer
\item S\+D\+L2-\/ttf
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://openil.sourceforge.net/}{\tt Dev\+IL}
\end{DoxyItemize}

All of these can be obtained using {\ttfamily apt-\/get} on Ubuntu. If you want to get them all at once, run


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev \(\backslash\)
    libglew-dev freeglut3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libdevil-dev
\end{DoxyCode}
 You\textquotesingle{}ll likely already have some of these (e.\+g. libxmu-\/dev and libxi-\/dev)

On Mac, you can get them using {\ttfamily brew}.

\subsection*{Note}

There are a few dependencies (none of the ones listed above) that come with the project. In an attempt to limit the repo\textquotesingle{}s size, I\textquotesingle{}ve included (parts of) them directly instead of as submodules. These can be found in the \href{https://github.com/NivenT/jubilant-funicular/tree/master/deps}{\tt deps} folder and include


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html}{\tt glm}
\item \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui}{\tt Dear Imgui} (Optional)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/ebachard/imgui_tabs}{\tt Imgui\+\_\+tabs}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/dtschump/CImg}{\tt C\+Img} (Optional) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
