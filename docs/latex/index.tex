\section*{Description}

This is a library to aid in the creation of (2D) games using Open\+GL and S\+D\+L2. It was originally created while following tutorials on the \href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5m1_llmeiAdZMo_ZanIvg}{\tt Making\+Games\+With\+Ben} youtube channel, but it has since grown into its own library, and so has many differences from \href{https://github.com/Barnold1953/GraphicsTutorials}{\tt the one} written in that series. This library is here for me to learn a little about game development.

I am using this library to write \href{https://github.com/NivenT/Planet}{\tt this game}. If you are interesting in using this for your own project, then looking in the {\ttfamily examples} folder may be helpful.

Ideally this entire library would work equally well on Linux, O\+SX, and Windows. In practice, the code is only tested on Linux, so while I try to keep things O\+S-\/agnostic, I cannot promise this is the case. Open an issue if it fails to build on your computer.

Documentation can be found \href{https://nivent.github.io/jubilant-funicular/html/index.html}{\tt here}

\section*{Requirements}

In a perfect world there would be no dependencies and all the necessary code would be written by me; however, in our world you should make sure you have


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.opengl.org/}{\tt Open\+GL}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://glew.sourceforge.net/}{\tt Glew}
\item \href{http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/}{\tt G\+L\+UT}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php}{\tt S\+D\+L2}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+D\+L2-\/mixer (Optional)
\item S\+D\+L2-\/ttf
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://openil.sourceforge.net/}{\tt Dev\+IL} (Optional)
\end{DoxyItemize}

All of these can be obtained using {\ttfamily apt-\/get} on Ubuntu. If you want to get them all at once, run


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev \(\backslash\)
    libglew-dev freeglut3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libdevil-dev
\end{DoxyCode}
 You\textquotesingle{}ll likely already have some of these (e.\+g. libxmu-\/dev and libxi-\/dev)

On Mac, you can get them using {\ttfamily brew}.

If you don\textquotesingle{}t want to use the ones labelled Optional, check out the {\ttfamily option}s in \href{https://github.com/NivenT/jubilant-funicular/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L45}{\tt C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt}.

\subsection*{Building Library (Along with Examples and Tests)}

If you want to build this library in isolation, the do the following 
\begin{DoxyCode}
git clone https://github.com/NivenT/jubilant-funicular
cd jubilant-funicular
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
\end{DoxyCode}


After that, to run all the tests you just need to call {\ttfamily make test}. The tests are built inside {\ttfamily tests/tests\+\_\+bin}, so if you want to run one individually, then do something like the following (from inside the build folder) 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd tests/tests\_bin
cd utils
./path\_tests
\end{DoxyCode}


The examples have to be run manually (i.\+e. there\textquotesingle{}s no {\ttfamily make example}). They are build inside {\ttfamily examples\+\_\+bin}, so you can run one by doing something like (from inside the build folder) 
\begin{DoxyCode}
cd examples\_bin
cd basic\_square
./basic\_square
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Note}

There are a few dependencies (none of the ones listed above) that come with the project. In an attempt to limit the repo\textquotesingle{}s size, I\textquotesingle{}ve included (parts of) them directly instead of as submodules. These can be found in the \href{https://github.com/NivenT/jubilant-funicular/tree/master/deps}{\tt deps} folder and include


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html}{\tt glm}
\item \href{https://github.com/ocornut/imgui}{\tt Dear Imgui} (Optional)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/ebachard/imgui_tabs}{\tt Imgui\+\_\+tabs}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/dtschump/CImg}{\tt C\+Img} (Optional) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
