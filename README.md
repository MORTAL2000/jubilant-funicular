I think technically this is a game engine. Whatever it is, it's certainly incomplete and in-development...

# Description
This is a library to aid in the creation of (2D) games using OpenGL and SDL2. It was originally created while following tutorials on the [MakingGamesWithBen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5m1_llmeiAdZMo_ZanIvg) youtube channel, but it has its differences from the library written in that series. This library is here for me to learn a little about game development; it's not production quality, so I can't recommend using it in your own projects. However, if you want an example of what's buildable with it, you can check out [this game](https://github.com/NivenT/Planet) that I'm writing in part just to exercise this library.

# Requirements
Ideally, there would be no dependencies and all the necessary code would be written by me, but that's not the case, so make sure you have

* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)
* [Glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* [DevIL](http://openil.sourceforge.net/)

Most, if not all, of these can be obtained using `apt-get` on Ubuntu.
